# LethalHands

Allows the usage of your hands to fight back in dire situations.

### Usage

Press 'J' (configurable) to toggle the ability to throw left (LMB) and right (RMB) punches.
For most entities, punches will have a 50% chance to deal shovel/sign damage.

If squaring up brings you to third person, make sure LethalEmotesAPI's third person mode is set to normal.
To do that, bring up the emote wheel ('c'), 'customize' (top right corner) and adjust the value in the top left menu.

### Installation

The future is now, use a mod manager you fool

Every player needs to have the mod installed.

### Configuration

How balanced the mod is can be adjusted in the `BepInEx/config/SlapitNow.LethalHands.cfg` file or using [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/).
The adjustable values are:
- 'PunchRange' : How far the punches can reach [1.2]  (for reference, shovel is 1.5 and knife is 0.75)
- 'PunchCooldown' : How many secondes you must wait between punches [1]
- 'PunchDamage' : How much damage punches deal [1]
- 'StaminaDrain' : How much stamina (% of max stamina) is drained per punch [0]
- 'ChanceToDealDamage' : How likely punches are to deal 1 damage (equivalent to 1 shovel/knife hit) [0.5]
